# Mridul Sarkar's Undergraduate Thesis on Open Source Quantum Algorithm Library

Working on an implementation of a quantum algorithm to find min. of an unsorted table.

This thesis will provide as an educational resource for a quick introduction to quantum computing, the basic mathematics and quantum physics concepts, and finally a exciting implementation and open source library for QESA and QMSA as proposed by Durr and Hoyer. 

Here is a circuit showcasing the algorithm with a random index of 0 and 2 items in the list.

# Future Plans

1.QESA will be implemented to solve for more than one solution and unknown number of solutions
2.User manipulation of QESA iteration, thereby gaining control of run time as well as probabilistic outcome
3.Collaborate with otherst to set up cool projects with QMSA/QESA!
